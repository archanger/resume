In IT since 2006(first dive). My route was step by step - I tried to code something with Delphi, followed the C language, and later discovered PHP. Finding my first job as a PHP developer was challenging due to a lack of experience. I continued to study C/C++ and got a job in Performance Lab as a Test-Engineer. In this position, I gained experience in Java and applied C knowledge. At some point, I became aware of iOS and decided to try this platform. After three months, I changed jobs and positions to an iOS developer. At the moment, I have about 10+ years of experience in iOS application development. During this time, I studied a lot of modern technologies and learned development approaches. Interested in cross-platform development and especially in Flutter, following trends in web development, have experience in TypeScript and React.

## Work Experience

### Bolt | 2019-2024 | Senior iOS Developer

I've been involved in many sub-projects focused on the main app improvements since the first day. From very crucial ones - like an introduction to unit tests - to the most detached from coding itself - setting up the interviewing pipeline for mobile developers and close work with HR department.

Besides that, I implemented 100+ features - from global screen re-design to the most unnoticeable UX improvements.

In a bit more detail:
* very proud of mentoring many developers and getting only positive feedback, seeing how they grow
* set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions as the core; collaboration with sibling teams was required.
* raised the app stability by incorporating a culture of unit tests, and later guided the introduction to snapshot tests 
* always share my knowledge through meetups and code reviews
* developed many design docs and RFCs describing further app improvements alongside future implementations
* built a hiring team of iOS engineers, developed a set of standard questions, and a live-coding task
